<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="public/img/diagram.png" alt="Diagram">

There are many great face-to-face video chatting platforms over the world, however, there aren't many free services that provide public debating rooms to any people.

Here's why Debateface is good:
* Anyone can be moderator or debator
* You can invite your friend or anyone to a debate room
* Moderator has several nice features
A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
